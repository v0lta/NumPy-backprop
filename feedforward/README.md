## MNIST digit recognition in numpy.

To run the experiments execute './download_mnist.sh'.
The script will create the './data' folder and extract
the MNIST train and test samples there.

To train and test the dense classifier run
'python train_dense_mnist.py'.
similarly, the convolutional neural net can be trained
and tested by running
'python train_cnn_mnist.py' .

In both script also do a test run, which will take a little while.
