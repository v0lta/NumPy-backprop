LSTM and GRU cells in NumPy
---------------------------
Most scripts in here are alrady working, but I am going to polish things further.

Type i.e. 'python train_adding_lstm.py' to train an LSTM cell to solve the adding problem in NumPy. It takes a while to converge, as illustrated in the plot below.
